# Django Unchained

This project is a result of the ["Django Unchained"](https://lu.ma/Django-unchained) workshop conducted by the ["MDC Club"](https://www.linkedin.com/company/meta-developer-circles-gitam-visakhapatnam/). To run this project on your local machine, follow the steps outlined in the "Django Project Setup" section below.

## Django Project Setup

Follow the steps below to setup the Django project on your local machine.

1. **Install Django**
   Django can be installed using pip. Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   pip install django
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository**
   Use git to clone the repository.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Sai-Akshit/DjangoUnchained
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   Change your current directory to the project's directory.

   ```
   cd django_unchained
   ```

4. **Run the Server**
   Use Django's built-in server to run your project locally.
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

Now, you should be able to see your Django project running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your web browser.
